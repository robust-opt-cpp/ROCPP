# Results

Using the data listed in the paper:
* Retailer-Supplier(RSFC) Problem has objective value of 13531.7 (resp. 14,814.3) with box (resp. ellipsoidal) uncertainty set.
* Robust Pandoraâ€™s Box(PB) Problem has objective value of 2.12 (resp. 9.67 and 9.67) with K_t = 1 (resp. 2 and 3) for all time stages.
* Stochastic Best Box(BB) Problem has objective value of 934.2 (resp. 792.5) with 3 partitions on each uncertain parameter Value_1, Value_2, and Value_4 (resp. static decision rule with no partitions).

Note that while the replicated experiments should achieve consistent optimal objective value with the one in the paper, since an optimization problem can have more than one optimal solution, we don't require the optimal solutions to be the same.
